- are there specific subsets of (political) memes on which the models do worse/better?
	subsets can be based on visual/textual features.


- How do I answer a question about why did I use the models I did?
 - Why transformers?
 - Why these specific models?
 - Is it something we know the companies use? : my natural answer is that the companies would not disclose this (because it could be exploited knowing the model biases)

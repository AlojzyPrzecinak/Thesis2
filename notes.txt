- are there specific subsets of (political) memes on which the models do worse/better?
	subsets can be based on visual/textual features.


- How do I answer a question about why did I use the models I did?
 - Why transformers?
 - Why these specific models?
 - Is it something we know the companies use? : my natural answer is that the companies would not disclose this (because it could be exploited knowing the model biases)
 --> prior work uses these models
 --> they make sense to be used - GEmini is sota, CLIP is text and vision

- citation style: am I allowed to choose? I think the LNCS format dictates it.
- shortening the introduction and related work - will it not make the thesis too short?
--> seems to be fine
- should I describe the method for the clip model? Maybe even visualise the vector operations? is this in line with this comment in the third section?
            "You cannot just present the models you use in a half-paragraph.
            I suggest giving this its own subsection and spending at least a paragraph per model to describe their details and how you use them, how you prompt them,
            if there is any tuning, etc."
--> add description of the models, look at other papers
--> visualisation of the workflow: input, output
--> what they are? what are they commonly used for? why for memes, how are they used in my case
- Im running the gemini results, just running out of the daily quotas.
--> use only the Gemini one with the definition, motivating that its been better so far
--> use cache, save the key index
- Section 4.2 comment is cut in the UI - what was the full content of it? Qualitative analysis in terms of examples is just showing the examples and predicted labels, right?
--> give story and interpretation of the examples, it can be speculative - 4.1 - qualitative analysis
--> 4.2 confusion matrix or small case (30 cases) error anylsis. OR both if time
- "why the without the definiotion the p-values are higher" - isnt it just a property of a mathematical formula?

- precision and recall - should I care about them and add the classification report?
    They are not used in literature (apart from F1 in the MOMENTA paper) and I could argue that since false positves and false negatives are not equally bad, they are not that useful.

- assuming I apply all the feedback, what is a grade I can ballpark expect?


POSTER PRESETNATION QUESTION:
- how do I introduce the topic (if at all)?
- dataset statistics - distribution of labels (?) maybe distribution of instances is better worded?
